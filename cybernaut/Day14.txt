1. Steps involved in creating a proper workspace:

1. Create a project folder.
2. Initialize a virtual environment using: `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the environment:
   - Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install required libraries using pip.
5. Create separate folders for scripts, data, and notebooks if needed.
6. Use a version control system (like Git).

2. What is web scraping:

Web scraping is an automated method to extract data from websites. 
It involves fetching the HTML content and parsing the data you need.

3. What library is used for web scraping:

- `BeautifulSoup` (for parsing HTML)
- `requests` (for fetching webpages)
Other options: `Selenium`, `Scrapy`

4. Describe HTML tree structure:

HTML documents are structured in a tree format known as the DOM (Document Object Model):
- Root: <html>
  - <head>
    - <title>
  - <body>
    - <div>
      - <p>, <a>, <img> (nested elements)
Each element is a "node" and can contain children.


5. Importance of .venv:

- `.venv` (virtual environment) isolates project dependencies.
- Prevents version conflicts between projects.
- Keeps your global Python environment clean.
