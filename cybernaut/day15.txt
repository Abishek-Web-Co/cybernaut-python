1. Steps involved in creating API:

1. Choose a web framework (like Flask or FastAPI).
2. Define routes (endpoints).
3. Write functions to handle requests.
4. Return responses in JSON format.
5. Test using tools like Postman.
6. Deploy using platforms like Heroku or Render.

2. What are the methods and their usage:

- GET: Retrieve data from server
- POST: Send new data to server
- PUT: Update existing data
- DELETE: Remove data

3. What is GitHub and why we use it:

GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting code using Git.
Uses:
- Version control
- Collaboration
- Backup and sharing
- Open source contribution

4. What API does:

API (Application Programming Interface) allows two applications to communicate.
It exposes endpoints to request or manipulate data.
Example: Weather API provides temperature data when requested.

5. What library you use for creating API:

- Flask (simple and lightweight)
- FastAPI (modern, high performance)
- Django REST framework (for Django-based apps)
